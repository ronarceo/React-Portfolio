# React Portfolio
            
## Description
This portfolio was built using React. It shows potential employers my previous projects, links to the deployed applications and Github repositories, information about me, a contact form, and a page where they can view or download my resume.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
